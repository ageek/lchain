An officer in uniform, of his rank, armed and identified as a captain stands at a short distance on the same platform, with a sentinel at each end of the bridge, standing with their rifles in the position of \"support\". The sentinels were tasked with blocking the foot planking that traversed the bridge, while an outpost was located at the further end beyond one of them, where the railroad ran straight away into a forest. Midway of the slope between the bridge and a fort made of vertical tree trunks, loopholed for rifles and commanded by a brass cannon, stood a single company of infantry in line at \"parade rest\".'"
